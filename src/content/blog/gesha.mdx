The Atari 2600 Plus is a brand new console that brings the original legendary Atari 2600 system into the modern age while preserving everything that made it special. Priced at $130, it may seem similar to other mini consoles on the market, but the Atari 2600 Plus has some unique features that set it apart and justify its slightly higher price point.

## Authentic Experience with Real Atari 2600 Cartridges

Unlike other mini consoles that come pre-loaded with games, the Atari 2600 Plus allows you to play games with real Atari 2600 cartridges. This means you can experience the games exactly as they were meant to be played, without any compromises. The console itself is almost identical to the original, but 80% of the size to make it more practical. It even uses the original controller inputs, so you can plug in an old Atari controller and it will work perfectly. Alternatively, you can use one of the new controllers on the original Atari 2600.

However, it should be noted that the Atari 2600 Plus may not be compatible with all controllers from other systems. While the Sega Mega Drive or Genesis controller was compatible with the original Atari 2600, it doesn't appear to be compatible with the 2600 Plus. This could potentially be added via a firmware update, but it's something to consider if you prefer using controllers from different systems.

## What's New with the Atari 2600 Plus?

In terms of new features, the Atari 2600 Plus offers a HDMI video output, making it easier to connect to modern TVs, and it is powered by a USB-C to standard USB cable. It doesn't come with a power adapter, so you'll need to have one already or use another device to power it.

The console comes with a single Atari 2600 cartridge that features 10 classic games. This mix of top tier classics and lesser-known titles allows you to experience a variety of gameplay. What's impressive is that the console replicates the entire experience of playing the original games. You need to flick the dip switches on the back of the cartridge in a specific pattern to choose the game you want to play, just like in the old days. The switches on the front of the device also function exactly as they did on the original, adding to the authentic feel.

## Playing Games on the Atari 2600 Plus

The Atari 2600 Plus uses software emulation to play the games from your cartridges, and the quality of emulation is excellent. Most games are compatible, with only a few exceptions. The console offers customization options such as aspect ratio, handicapping options, and the choice between color and black and white display. There is also an optional paddle controller bundle available for games that require it, providing a more immersive experience.

## Expanded Library and Future Support

In addition to the 10-in-1 cartridge that comes with the console, Atari is releasing enhanced versions of classic games and even developing new games for the Atari 2600. This commitment to expanding the library is impressive and ensures that there will be plenty of content to enjoy on the Atari 2600 Plus. The console is also compatible with Atari 7800 cartridges, further enhancing its game library.

The Atari 2600 Plus is not just a novelty console; it is a remarkable modern recreation of a groundbreaking console. It provides an opportunity to experience the nostalgia of Atari gaming while adding some quality-of-life features. Whether you're new to the Atari 2600 or a longtime fan, this console offers a convenient and authentic way to revisit the classic games that defined a generation.
