Arcade One Up, the brand of smaller arcade cabinets meant for home use, has captured the hearts of many gaming enthusiasts. These affordable machines offer a nostalgic arcade experience without breaking the bank. However, over time, the excitement surrounding Arcade One Up has waned for many fans, including myself. In this blog, we will explore my journey with Arcade One Up, from my initial excitement to my current disappointment, and discuss what I hope to see from the brand in the future.

# Childhood Dreams and the Arcade Cabinet Fantasy

As a child, I always dreamed of owning an arcade cabinet for my home. The allure of having an arcade machine, like the classic Pac-Man or Galaga, was irresistible to me. However, the high cost and maintenance required for these machines made it an unattainable dream. I resigned myself to the fact that owning an arcade cabinet was not feasible.

# The Birth of Arcade One Up

Then, in 2018, I discovered Arcade One Up. These smaller, more affordable arcade cabinets offered a glimmer of hope. Finally, I could have an arcade-like experience in my own home without breaking the bank. The concept was appealing, and I eagerly purchased my first cabinet, the Galaga machine.

Putting together the Arcade One Up cabinet was a breeze, and for the price, the quality was decent. It provided a good enough arcade experience, and I was satisfied with my purchase. Over the next few years, Arcade One Up released a variety of cabinets with different games and designs, and I eagerly added more to my collection.

# Arcade One Up's Downfall

However, as time went on, my enthusiasm for Arcade One Up began to wane. The brand seemed to be releasing the same cabinets with minor variations or upgrades. I felt burned when I realized that newer versions of the cabinets I had purchased were being released just months later.

The increasing prices of the cabinets also added to my disappointment. What was once a $300 purchase quickly escalated to $500 or even $700. I expected the quality to improve with the higher price point, but it remained relatively unchanged.

Furthermore, the design choices of Arcade One Up started to feel inconsistent. They attempted to replicate the look of original arcade machines, but the prominent Arcade One Up logo displayed above the LCD screen clashed with the authentic aesthetic. It felt like a cheap imitation rather than a genuine arcade experience.

# The Need for Innovation

Arcade One Up's constant release of similar cabinets and lack of meaningful improvements left me feeling disillusioned. As a dedicated fan, I still keep up with their announcements, hoping for something new and exciting. However, my excitement has dwindled, and I find myself questioning the value of these cabinets.

Instead, I am considering investing in a high-quality arcade machine from other reputable brands. While Arcade One Up provided an affordable entry point into the world of home arcade gaming, I now have the means to upgrade to a more substantial and satisfying experience.

# The Future of Arcade One Up

Despite my disappointment, I am still intrigued by Arcade One Up's potential. If the brand wants to win back fans like me, they need to focus on innovation and customer satisfaction. Here are a few suggestions:

- Offer downloadable games for existing cabinets to keep them updated and relevant.
- Improve the quality of components, such as buttons and arcade sticks, to enhance the overall gaming experience.
- Provide better design consistency across cabinets, either embracing the Arcade One Up aesthetic or fully replicating the original arcade machine look.
- Consider the needs of existing customers when releasing new versions or upgrades to avoid alienating loyal fans.
- Explore new partnerships and licenses to bring fresh and exciting games to the Arcade One Up lineup.

By taking these steps, Arcade One Up can regain the trust and enthusiasm of their fanbase. As for me, I plan to move on from Arcade One Up and pursue a more premium arcade machine that will bring me the joy and satisfaction I seek.
