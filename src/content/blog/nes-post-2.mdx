intro: The NES Classic Edition is a wonderful reminder of the timeless appeal of classic 8-bit games. This compact retro console comes pre-loaded with 30 iconic NES games, including Super Mario Brothers, Mega Man 2, and Punch-Out. Priced at $59.99, it offers high-quality emulation that surpasses the NES Virtual Console on the Wii U. However, despite its remarkable authenticity, the NES Classic Edition falls short with its inconveniently short controller wires.

# Attention to Detail

Right out of the box, the NES Classic Edition impresses with its attention to detail. The compact console perfectly captures the look and feel of the original Nintendo Entertainment System, complete with soft clickable power and reset buttons. Almost every aspect of it is a faithful reproduction of the original, just in a smaller form factor. The only noticeable differences are the addition of an HDMI and a USB power input at the back, as well as a custom menu screen that beautifully emulates the 90s style icons.

# The Controller Conundrum

The wired NES controller is also meticulously designed, with a smoother and lighter d-pad compared to the original. However, the main issue lies in its 2.5 ft cable length, which connects to the system through a proprietary port called the wi accessory connector. Unfortunately, Nintendo does not offer wireless adapters for the NES Classic Edition, meaning users have limited options. To comfortably play, one must either sit close to the television, purchase a controller cable extender, or invest in long HDMI and power extension cords. Additionally, the need to press the reset button to access the home menu and switch games exacerbates this issue, as the console must be within arm's reach.

# Visual Splendor

Despite the controller limitations, the NES Classic Edition excels in delivering a visually stunning gaming experience. The colorful worlds of the 30 classic NES games have never looked better. Whether you're exploring the imaginative stages of Super Mario Brothers 3 or scouring Hyrule in search of hidden secrets in The Legend of Zelda, this tiny console brings these games to life. You can choose between displaying games in a crystal-clear 4:3 mode, an artificially fuzzy CRT mode, or a Pixel Perfect mode that provides a more modern look.

# A Limited Library

While the emulation quality of the NES Classic Edition rivals more expensive retro console setups, its biggest drawback is its fixed library of 30 games. There is no option to purchase or load new games onto the console. If a desired game, such as Ice Hockey or Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse, is not included in the initial lineup, there is no way to add it to the collection. This limitation is disappointing for those hoping for an expanded gaming experience.

# A Blast from the Past

Despite the controller cable inconvenience and limited game selection, the NES Classic Edition still makes a compelling case for nostalgic gaming. It offers an easy way to relive old favorites and introduce them to a new generation. If you're willing to overlook the controller limitations and embrace the best parts of your childhood gaming memories, the NES Classic Edition is a must-have.
