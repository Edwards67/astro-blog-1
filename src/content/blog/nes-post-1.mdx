If you're a fan of retro video games, then you're in for a treat. The Cub X3 is a retro video game console that promises to deliver thousands of classic games right to your fingertips. In this review, we'll take a closer look at this console and see if it lives up to the hype.

# Specifications and Features

The Cub X3 comes with impressive specifications that make it a contender in the world of retro gaming. It features 32 gigabytes of built-in space and four gigabytes of RAM, ensuring smooth gameplay. Running on the S905x3 Android 9.0 operating system, this console offers a user-friendly experience.

One standout feature of the Cub X3 is its four USB ports, two at the front and two at the back. This allows for easy connectivity and the option to connect multiple controllers. Additionally, the console has AV, local area network, HDMI, and power buttons, providing convenience and versatility.

# The Game Library

The Cub X3 boasts an impressive game library, with a count of 107,833 games. However, it's important to note that there may be duplicates in the library, as some games appear in multiple regions or variants. While the console covers popular systems like NES, Super Nintendo, Sega Saturn, and more, it may not offer the complete library for each system.

It's worth mentioning that the console also includes ROM hacks, which can add an extra layer of excitement for avid gamers. However, it's important to manage expectations and understand that not every game will run flawlessly on the system.

# Performance and Compatibility

When it comes to performance, the Cub X3 shines in handling 8 and 16-bit games. These classics run smoothly on the system, providing an enjoyable gaming experience. The console also proves capable of handling systems like Nintendo 64 and Dreamcast, although some games may have minor glitches.

One area where the console may struggle is with more demanding systems like PlayStation and PSP. While PS1 games run without issues, it's important to note that there may be no music included to save space. Full PSP releases can be hit or miss, with some games running well and others experiencing performance issues.

# Final Thoughts

The Cub X3 offers a convenient way to access thousands of retro games in one console. While it may not have a perfect game library and can encounter minor issues with certain systems, it still provides a fun and nostalgic gaming experience. Whether you choose to invest in the Cub X3 or take on the challenge of building your own retro gaming setup, the choice ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget.
