Arcade One Up cabinets are 3/4 size replicas of classic arcade machines. They come with multiple games pre-installed, allowing you to enjoy a variety of gaming experiences in one cabinet. The cabinets have evolved over the years, with newer models offering better quality and features. Let's take a closer look at some key aspects of Arcade One Up cabinets.

# Selection of Games

Arcade One Up cabinets offer a wide range of games to choose from. Whether you're a fan of fighting games like Mortal Kombat or enjoy classics like Pac-Man and Galaga, there is a cabinet for every taste. However, it's important to note that some cabinets have limited game selections, so make sure to choose one that aligns with your preferences.

# Quality and Manufacturing

When it comes to quality, Arcade One Up cabinets have had mixed reviews. Early generation cabinets had manufacturing problems, including shipping damage and missing parts. However, recent models have shown improvement in craftsmanship and packaging. It's worth noting that some older cabinets can be modified with aftermarket parts, such as lit-up marquees, to enhance their appearance.

# Customer Service

Arcade One Up's customer service has been a point of concern for many buyers. Dealing with their support system can be frustrating, often resulting in long response times. However, joining online communities like Facebook groups or Reddit can provide better support and access to helpful resources.

# Alternative Options

If you're looking for a more customized gaming experience, there are alternative options to consider. For example, you can purchase a basic cabinet and install your own Raspberry Pi, which allows you to play a wide range of games. Another option is the Legends Ultimate Machine, which offers more advanced features and the ability to play PlayStation 2 games. These alternatives require more technical knowledge and setup, but they provide greater flexibility.

# Final Thoughts

Arcade One Up cabinets can be a great addition to any game room or man cave. They offer a nostalgic gaming experience and come in a variety of game options. However, it's important to consider the quality and customer service aspects before making a purchase. If you're willing to invest time and effort in customization, alternative options might be worth exploring. Ultimately, the choice depends on your personal preferences and gaming needs.
